# AP Computer Science A
This repo contains all of the source code files for the AP Computer Science A course's "lab work" assignments. The folder structure will hopefully follow an intuitive nesting order with section names for folders and exercise numbers for files. I'll also try to document the workings of the programs via comments throughout the source if anything seems vague or arcane.
