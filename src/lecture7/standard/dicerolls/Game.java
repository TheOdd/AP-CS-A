/*
 * Standard
 * 
 * Write a Dice library (class) for D&D. Include at minimum (a) a static method to roll a die of n
 * sides and (b) a second static method that takes as parameters the number of
 * 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 20-sided dice to roll and returns the sum. Feel free to add other methods as 
 * you see useful (e.g. if youâ€™re a White Wolf or Shadowrun fan, you might write a method that 
 * accepts a number of 10-sided dice to roll and the minimum passing value, and determines how many
 * successes were rolled). Write a program (i.e. more than just Dice.java) that at least trivially
 * uses your Dice library.
